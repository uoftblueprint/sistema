# Sistema

Sistema Toronto provides musical and intellectual opportunities to children in vulnerable communities, with the goal of transformative social change. They build stronger communities by enabling children from marginalized neighbourhoods to overcome poverty, grow, and thrive as engaged citizens and future leaders. They are collaborating with us this year to create a mobile application that will help with their mission.

You can learn more about their organization here: https://www.sistema-toronto.ca/
